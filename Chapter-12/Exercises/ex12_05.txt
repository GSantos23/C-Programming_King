Suppose that a is a one-dimensional array and p is a pointer variable. Assuming
that the assigment p = a has just been performed, which of the following
expressions are illegal because of mismatched types? Of the remaining expressions,
which are true (have a nonzero value)?

(a) p == a[0]		-- Illegal
(b) p == &a[0]		-- Legal
(c) *p == a[0]		-- Legal
(d) p[0] == a[0]	-- Legal
