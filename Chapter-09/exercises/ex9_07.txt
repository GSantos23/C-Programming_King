Suppose that the function f has the following definition:

int f(int a, int b) {...}

Which of the following statements are legal? (Assume that i has type int and x has
type double)

(a) i = f(83,12);           ----- Valid
(b) x = f(83,12);           ----- Valid
(c) i = f(3.15,9.28);       ----- Truncated
(d) x = f(3.15,9.28);       ----- Truncated
(e) f(83,12);               ----- Valid
