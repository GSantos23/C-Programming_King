The Q&A section shows how to use a letter as an array subscript. Describe how
to use a digit (in character form) as a subscript.

It is necessary to scale the value as well

int digit_count[10];

digit_count[ch-'0'];

As the book mentions, this technique isn't completely portable, because it assumes
that digits have consecuetives codes.
