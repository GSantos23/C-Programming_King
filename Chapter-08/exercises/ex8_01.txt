Exercise 8.1 - We discussed using the expression sizeof(a) / sizeof(a[0]) to
calculate the number of elements on an array. 
The expression sizeof(a) / sizeof(t), where t is the type of element, would also 
work, but it's considered an inferior techinique. Why?

The problem with sizeof(a) / sizeof(t) is that it can't easily be checked for 
correctness by someone reading the program. 
(The reader would have to locate the declaration of a and make sure that its 
elements have type t.)
